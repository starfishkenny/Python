    "## Choosing Plot Types (from Kaggle)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trends \n",
    "* A pattern of change\n",
    "* sns.lineplot - Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship\n",
    "* Can be used to understand relationships between variables in the data\n",
    "* sns.barplot - Bar charts are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups\n",
    "* sns.heatmap - Heatmaps can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers\n",
    "* sns.scatterplot - Scatter plots show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable\n",
    "* sns.regplot - Including a regression line in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables\n",
    "* sns.lmplot - This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups\n",
    "* sns.swarmplot - Categorical scatter plots show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution \n",
    "* Can be used to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are\n",
    "* sns.distplot - Histograms show the distribution of a single numerical variable.\n",
    "* sns.kdeplot - KDE plots (or 2D KDE plots) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables)\n",
    "* sns.jointplot - This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable"
